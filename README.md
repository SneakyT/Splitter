###TO-DO

  9. Make screens pretty
    - grab, edit or produce a new theme.
    - centralize stuff (done? - needs testing on other devices)
  
  2. Set up either (hooks in place to support both - remove one?)
      1. Random tip generator and who pays it 
      2. add option to include tip

  3. Change logo

  4. Add option to work out what people owe you if you have already paid the bill on your own
  
  5. Validate Config screen so people aren't dividing by 0 and crashing the app.
  
  6. Refactor Fragmented Output activity.
  
  7. Display Contacts list in one Output fragment and update values as to who owes what in the other fragment.
